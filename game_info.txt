Welcome to Hunt the Wumpus.
Your job is to slay the wumpus living in the cave using bow and arrow.
In addition to the wumpus, the cave has two hazards: bottomless pits and
giant bats. If you enter a room with a bottomless pit, it's the end of the
game for you. If you enter a room with a bat, the bat picks you up and
drops you into another room. If you enter the room with the wumpus or he
enters yours, he eats you. When you enter a room you will be told if a
hazard is nearby:
	"You smell the wumpus!": It's in an adjacent room.
	"You feel a breeze!": One of the adjacent rooms is a bottomless pit.
	"You hear flapping!": A giant bat is in an adjacent room.
During each turn you must make a move. The possible moves are:
	"m #": Move to an adjacent room.
	"s #[-#[-#]]": Shoot an arrow through the rooms specified. The
		first room number specified must be an adjacent room. The
		range of an arrow is 3 rooms, and a path will be chosen at
		random if not specified. You have 5 arrows at the start of
		the game.
	"q": Quit the game and flee the cave.
Good luck!
